## Project info

**Overview**

Trip Prep Assistant (TPA) is an AI-integrated website designed to help users pack efficiently and confidently for any trip. By leveraging automation and personalization, TPA ensures users know exactly how many clothes and essentials to bring—eliminating the stress of forgetting items or overpacking. The core value is to provide peace of mind and a streamlined packing experience, tailored to each user’s trip details and preferences.

This is a prototype that shows the main features and interaction flows; it does not include any weather or AI agent API integration.
