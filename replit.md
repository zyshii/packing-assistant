# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built using React with TypeScript and follows a component-based architecture:

- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript for type safety
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library for consistent design
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **State Management**: React hooks with localStorage for persistence, TanStack Query for server state
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
- **UI Components**: Comprehensive set of accessible components from Radix UI

The application uses a modern design system with HSL color variables, ensuring WCAG AA compliance for accessibility. All semantic colors (success, info, warning, neutral) meet or exceed 4.5:1 contrast ratios for text and maintain proper contrast for interactive elements. Enhanced focus states and border visibility support keyboard navigation and screen readers.

## Backend Architecture

The backend follows a REST API pattern with Express.js:

- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Storage Interface**: Abstracted storage layer with in-memory implementation (expandable to database)
- **API Structure**: RESTful endpoints with `/api` prefix
- **Development**: Hot reload with Vite integration for seamless full-stack development

The server implements a clean separation between routing logic and storage operations through an interface-based approach.

## Data Storage Solutions

The application uses a flexible storage architecture:

- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM configured for PostgreSQL with schema definitions
- **Current Implementation**: PostgreSQL database with DatabaseStorage class (updated from in-memory storage)
- **Schema Management**: Centralized schema definitions in `/shared/schema.ts`
- **Migration Support**: Drizzle Kit for database schema migrations
- **Data Persistence**: PostgreSQL database for server data, client-side localStorage for trip data and user preferences

The storage interface allows easy switching between in-memory and database implementations without code changes. Database was integrated on August 1, 2025.
